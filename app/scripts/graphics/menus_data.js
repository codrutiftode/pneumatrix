            <i style=" font-size: 12px; color: gray;">A Pneumatics Simulator</i>
        </h1>
        <p>This is (hopefully) one of the best software apps out there for simulating pneumatic circuits. If you ever feel like you need help with how it works (after all, I am also sometimes puzzled by software, even my own), this page will be here for you.</p>

        <h3>Video Tutorial</h3>
        <p>

        <h3>The Toolbox</h3>
        <p>
            <img src="app/res/tutorial/toolbox.png"><br><br>The toolbox contains everything you might be looking for in this app.
            <br><br>
            You can click on a pneumatic symbol and drag it into the empty rest of the screen. When you drop it, it will remain there,
            and then you can drag it again to change its position.
            <br><br>
            You can also scroll up and down in the toolbox. And if you click on the "search" box at the top, you might even be able to filter the symbols and find what you need more quickly.
        </p>

        <h3>The Main Menu</h3>
        <p>
            <img src="app/res/tutorial/mainmenu.jpg"><br><br>
            This is the place to go if you need to change the settings of the app, save or open your projects, or even visit this great page you are reading right now.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Settings</b> - allows you to change the global parameters of the software.</li>
            <li><b>Info</b> - Displays this tutorial.</li>
            <li><b>Open</b> - Opens a pneumatics project and loads all components on screen.</li>
            <li><b>Save</b> - Saves a pneumatics project on your computer with all components. Whenever you need it, you can open it using the 'Open' button in the menu.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Open & Save</h3>
        <p>
            In order to preserve your work when refreshing or closing the page, you will need to save your work. In order to do this, click on the <b>'Save'</b>
            button in the Main Menu (this menu is described above) and follow the instructions. Afterwards, you can close the program and when you return,
            just click on <b>'Open'</b>, navigate to where you saved the file and open it to have your pneumatic circuit back on the screen and ready to go.
        </p>

        <h3>The Main Air Line</h3>
        <p>
            <img src="app/res/tutorial/mainair.jpg" style="width: 100%;">
            The main air line is the main source of air for your pipes. It pumps air through its connectors (the white circles).
            <br><br>
            It also has an ON/OFF button to activate/deactivate the flow of air (<b>very useful</b> in real life, trying to change your piping
            with the air on can lead to injuries and nightmares).
        </p>

        <h3>Box Operations</h3>
        <p>
            <img src="app/res/tutorial/contextmenu.jpg">
            Right click on any pneumatic component to show this menu. Here you can find many useful operations, such as 'remove' or 'flip x' (flip horizontally).
            <br><br>
            <u>Pro tip</u>: Another way to remove a component is to drag it over the toolbox - it will simply disappear, along with any pipe connected to it.
        </p>

        <h3>Connecting Boxes</h3>
        <p style="text-align: left;">
            <img src="app/res/tutorial/connected_boxes_annotated.jpg">
            <u>Steps:</u><br><br>
            1. Click on the starting endpoint;<br>
            2. Move your mouse vertically, click to change direction;<br>
            3. Click on the chosen final endpoint.<br><br>

            <u>Pro Tips:</u><br>
            - To cancel drawing a pipe, press Escape (Esc).<br>
            - To <b>remove</b> a pipe, hold Control (Ctrl) and click on the pipe.
        </p>

        <h3>Actuators</h3>
        <p>To change the state of a valve (in pneumatic terms, to actuate it), simply click on the actuator on the right or the left of the pneumatic box.
        <br><br>Types of actuators currently supported: Push-button, roller, spring, solenoid.
        <br><i>Note:</i> The roller can be actuated by a cylinder, the spring needs to be clicked to work (for now, at least).
        </p>
