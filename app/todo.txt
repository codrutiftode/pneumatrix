TO DO:
1. 5/2 valve correction - implement tree of precedence model for main air inputs in simulation - DONE!!!! :)))
2. cylinder signal on both sides - DONE !!!
3. rotating valves
4. Add components (below)
5. Change title and favicon
6. Reload the circuit after downloading it to prevent the paths from getting crooked
7. Scan pneumatic diagram to simulate it

TO ADD:
1. Shuttle valve DONE !!!!
2. T pieces DONE !!!!
3. Reservoir
4. Solenoid actuator DONE !!!

ISSUES:
1. Moving one box over another makes the endpoints look and behave weirdly.
2. (!important) make pneumatic boxes unable to overlap each other
3. Adding two points close together with the endpoint of a box in a path has a strange effect when moving the box (the path becomes angled)
