===== CONVENTIONS: =====

# Each endpoint is a circle with 1px of border and 9px of width and height
# Each cylinder can only extend 90px
# The number of vertical segments on the main air line is 6
# Each dict in ENDPOINTS_COORDINATES has a key called 'location' that has two
possible values:
    - "x" for 'the endpoint is on the top or bottom of the box'
    - "y" for 'the endpoint is on the left or the right of the box'
- 'location' is also set as a custom html attribute for endpoints in the DOM.

# In createToolboxSymbol(), the toolActuators parameter is a string in the format:
{[initial of actuator1]:[initial of actuator2]}
ex: {b:s} - button on the left, spring on the right

# Values for actuators:
b - button
s - spring
r - roller

# VALVE_CONF:
Contains the configurations for each box following the specification:
- key "1" means the "right" state, key "-1" means the "left" state.
- all boxes are initially in the "right" state.
- each state key ("1" or "-1") points to an array of size 2, containing two endpoints
- the endpoints are numbered starting from 0. On the screen, from top to bottom, left to right.
- an endpoint number of "-1" means a "main air" connection (like in the case of the 52 valve)
